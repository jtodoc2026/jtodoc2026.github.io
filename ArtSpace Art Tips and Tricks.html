                        <h3>Tip#1: Explore Different Mediums</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the art field, there are a variety of art mediums you can use to create a piece. From charcoal and graphite 
                            pencils to watercolor, acrylic, and oil paints (and definitely many more). During these modern times, there is 
                            also an addition of digital art to the different art mediums. Among these varieties of art mediums, it is very 
                            important to know which art medium you work the best with. I, in particular, use watercolor and gouache combined 
                            because I feel the most comfortable with it. However, I didn’t immediately know that these mediums were “the one”. 
                            I went through using crayons, oil pastels, colored pencils and markers, oil paint, poster color, and digital art,
                            though all of them did not sit that well with me. This is why try to experiment and explore. Find the medium you're
                            good at, improve your strengths, then once you've already mastered that medium, try experimenting with more mediums
                            or challenge yourself by using the mediums you have difficulty handling. You never know what great things could 
                            happen if you don't try.
                
                        </p>
                
                        <h3>Tip#2: Don't Be Afraid to Make Mistakes</h3>
                        <p>
                            It’s alright to have artworks that don’t work out. It's okay if some of your artworks are not up to your expectations. 
                            It's okay to throw away pieces that you aren't satisfied with. Art is also a form of experimentation, so just be 
                            patient and things will work out soon ^^
                        </p>
                    
                        <h3>Tip#3: Create Your Own Art Style</h3>
                        <p>
        
                            If you're trying to find your art style, you can try gathering and combining the specific features that you 
                            about your favorite artist's art style then you can add your own preferences and style to make it your own. 
                        </p>
        
                        <h3>Tip#4: Learn From Other Artists</h3>
                        <p>
                            If you don't know where or how to start, try looking at the artworks of other artists and allow yourself to be
                            inspired. There are tens and thousands of techniques, tips, and tricks that you can learn from them. 
        
                        </p>
        
                        <h3>Tip#5: Practice, Practice, and Practice</h3>
                        <p>
                            Simply knowing the concepts behind great art isn't enough to create great art. Practice or applying these concepts 
                            is essential because there are some things and techniques that can only be realized or achieved through practice. 
                            Making art journals is one way to do it. You can either draw your surroundings, a simple doodle, or have daily/weekly art 
                            challenges to enhance your creativity and skill.  
                        </p>
        
                        <h3>Tip#6: Don't Procrastinate </h3>
                        <p>
                            It's not only in academics where procrastinating is discouraged, it's also in art. Try starting a piece as soon 
                            as you have an idea. Leaving your ideas on your waiting list will eventually cause you to be less motivated in doing it. 
                        </p>
        
                        <h3>Tip#7: Use References </h3>
                        <p>
                            Some may say that drawings with references are unoriginal or considered cheating. However, references actually 
                            play a big part in our development as artists. By simply observing and drawing the objects surrounding uou we get 
                            to improve our fundamentals in art such as form, shape, shadow, proportions, perspective, and more! We also get to 
                            see the world in a different and more detailed way.
                        </p>
        
                        <h3>Tip#8: Use Good Materials to Make Good Art </h3>
                        <p>
                            Practicing and developing art skills is important, but to take artwork to the next level, make sure to use good quality 
                            materials and the right mediums on the right surfaces. I ensure you that it will make a huge difference in the outcome of your 
                            artwork. 
                        </p>
        
                        <h3>Tip#9: Do Not Compare Yourself To Others </h3>
                        <p>
                            It's fine to look at the work of other artists for inspiration, but try not to let it demotivate 
                            you by comparing your own work to theirs. Every person has a unique, individual style. Everyone's pace of artistic 
                            development also differs from one person to another. 
                        </p> 
        
                        <h3>Tip#10: Have Fun! </h3>
                        <p>
                            Lastly, a friendly reminder to have fun doing what you love! Don't forget to trust and enjoy the process while 
                            you're at it!
